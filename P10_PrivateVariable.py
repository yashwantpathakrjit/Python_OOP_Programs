# In this example we will see how the private variables work in Python

class Person(object):

        self.name = name
        self.__education = 'Engineering'         # Private Variable

    def displayInfo(self):

        education = self.__education             # Can only be accessed within the class
        print('My name is', name, 'and I have completed my', education)

    print(myObj._Person__education)             # Private variable can be accessed like this but NEVER EVER
                                                # do this please!!!
